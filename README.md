# ðŸ¥ž Rubyswap Frontend

the stuff below is the old readme this is the new read me

basically:

git clone

git checkout develop-osoese

yarn install

yarn start

yarn build

I have the home page variable in package.json set to "./"

and converted to hashrouter for use on ipfs

here is a test build up that works (if you compile code from the previous commit hash d8feafe..d6fb62b  develop-osoese branch and build the project and load the build folder into ipfs it would be cool if you match this hash below)
